# owu!beta  (fork of Webosu)

The beta of a fork of a browser rhythm game where players click circles following rhythm of the music.

Made possible with [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com). Beatmap API: [Sayobot](https://osu.sayobot.cn).

Note: Some music might not be perfectly synced and modes other than osu! (standard) are unsupported.

## Hosting

Set up a surge.sh site with the root directory located where `index.html` is in, usually public_html or something

```bash
npm install --global surge
```
```bash
surge
```
## Beta stuff
I'll check both repos for Issue tickets but im more likely to fix it quicker if you file the issue here so that it neer makes it to the main branch (just a FYI).

Don't use this site to play on as if it were the stable one as I restart the site frequently to update.

Most emportly feel free to share!

The main thing I did to tweak this project is I translated the Chinese to English and hosted it myself
