# owu!  (fork of [Webosu](https://github.com/111116/webosu))

A fork of a browser rhythm game where players click circles following rhythm of the music.

Made possible with [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com). Beatmap API: [Sayobot](https://osu.sayobot.cn).

Credits for gameplay go to [original repo](https://github.com/111116/webosu)
## Hosting

npm install --global surge
```
```bash
